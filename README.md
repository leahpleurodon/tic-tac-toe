# tic-tac-toe
This is project 1 for GA - tic tac toe

---

### Gameplay

Tic-tac toe is a game where 2 players compete to see who can get three or more of their markers in a row.

In order to start playing, each player can enter their name to personalise the game, this is optional however.

---

### Pipeline

Future considerations:

- Ability to change token
- Custom board size
- Add time limits.

---

### Planning

Planning can be found in the planning directory in the parent directory.

### New functions learned


#### Conditional (ternary) Operator

Rather than using 

```
if (condition){
    result1
}else{
    result2
}
```

It can be written as 

```
(condition ? result1 : result2);
```

I chose this for readability.

#### removeEventListener

removes event listeners from DOM elements.


#### Playing Audio

```
new Audio("audioURL")

.play()

```
